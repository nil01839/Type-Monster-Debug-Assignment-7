                <p class="font-semibold">sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
                    localStorage doesn't expire, data in
                    sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in
                    the browser,
                    a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

                <h2 class="card-title">what is the difference between global scope and block scope? </h2>
                <p>in javascript the whole document is global scope and all the other functions and variables are contained in
                    this global
                    scope. Another is the Local Scope, variables declared inside the functions are considered to be of the local
                    scope and
                    it is futher divided into function scoped and block scoped.</p>

                <p>8 Ways to get Undefined:
                    A declared variable without assigning any value to it.
                    Implicit returns of functions due to missing return statements.
                    return statements that do not explicitly return anything.
                    Lookups of non-existent properties in an object.
                    Function parameters that have not passed.
                    Anything that has been set to the value of undefined.
                    Any expression in the form of void(expression)
                    The value of the global variable undefined</p>
